\title{Subset sequences from sq objects}
\usage{
bite(x, indices)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{\link{sq}} object.}

\item{indices}{a \code{\link{numeric}} vector of subsequence indices to extract from
each sequence. The function follows the normal R conventions for indexing 
vectors, including negative indices.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{sq}} object of the same type as input sq, where each 
element is a subsequence created by indexing corresponding sequence from 
input sq object with input indices.
}
\description{
Extracts a defined range of elements (amino acids or nucleotides) 
from a sequence.
}
\details{
Amino acids and nucleic acid sequences are represented as \code{\link{sq}} 
object in the \code{\link{tidysq}} package. Often one needs to get only a 
single letter, or the sequence of a defined range from the original sequences. 
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original sequence 
by trimming some elements (letters) without changing the order of the 
remaining elements. To get a subsequence from each sequence contained in 
the \code{\link{sq}} object with the same indices. This is for example 
useful to extract a user-defined region from a sequence. 

The usage of \code{bite} follows the normal R conventions. For details 
refer to the R documentation (see 
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Index-vectors}). 
Extracting indices not present in the sequence results in introducing 
\code{\link{NA}} (‘Not Available’ / Missing Value) values. 
Information about it is printed on a console depending on the value of option 
'tidysq_a_bite_na' - it can be either a warning (default), an error,
a message or no information (you can check details in \code{\link{tidysq-options})}. 
\code{NA} values can be removed by using \code{\link{remove_na}} function.

# Creating object, called sq to work on:
# The first four sequences of are miRNAs and isomiRs that were taken from 
# Tan et al. (2014) Nucleic Acid Research, doi: 10.1093/nar/gku656. 
# Selected miR-9 (isomiRs) sequences from neural progenitor stem cells
# look as follows: TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGA, CTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGA, 
# TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATG, TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGAA
# The remaining sequences represent short artificial random sequences.
# Tan et al. have shown that "majority of miRNA genes encode mature isomers 
# that vary in size by one or more bases at the 3' and/or 5' end of the miRNA.
# In the following the bite function is used to trim nucleotieds 5' for a 
# simple visual alignment.
# construct_sq is used to create a sq object

sq <- construct_sq(c("TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGA", "CTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGA", 
                     "TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATG", "TCTTTGGTTATCTAGCTGTATGAA", 
                     "ACTGCTG", "CTTAGA", "CCCT", "CTGAATGT"), type = "dna")

# Get an overview of the sequences and show the first four only:
# The first four isomiRs sequences have lengths of 15, 14, 14 and 15
# nucleotides. The remaining artificial sequences have lengths of 5, 4, 3 
# and 5 nucleotides, respectively.
summary(sq)

# Working with the first four miRNA/isomiR
# Removing first letter from the first four sequences (miRNAs/isomiRs).
# The sequence 1, 3 and 4 appear to be more similar.
bite(sq[1:4], -1)

# Extracting first five letters from each miRNA/ismomiR sequence:
bite(sq[1:4], 1:5)

# Working with all sequences
# Extracting first letter from each sequence:
bite(sq, 1)

# Extracting first three letters from each sequence:
bite(sq, 1:3)

# Extracting second, fourth, third and second letters:
bite(sq, c(2,4,3,2))

# Extracting second to fifth letter - NA introduced:
bite(sq, 2:5)

# Extracting all from first to twentieth - NA introduced:
bite(sq, 1:20)

# Extracting all excluding first letter of sequence:
bite(sq, -1)

# Extracting all excluding second and sixth letter of sequence:
bite(sq, c(-2, -6))
