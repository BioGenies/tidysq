\usage{
bite(x, indices, ...)

\method{bite}{sq}(
  x,
  indices,
  ...,
  NA_letter = getOption("tidysq_NA_letter"),
  on_warning = getOption("tidysq_on_warning")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{sq}]\cr
An object this function is applied to.}

\item{indices}{[\code{integer}]\cr
Indices to extract from each sequence. The function follows the normal R
conventions for indexing vectors, including negative indices.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed from or to other methods.}

\item{NA_letter}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
A string that is used to interpret and display \code{NA} value in the
context of \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq class}}. Default value equals to
"\code{!}".}

\item{on_warning}{[\code{"silent" || "message" || "warning" || "error"}]\cr
Determines the method of handling warning message. Default value is
\code{"warning"}.}
}
\value{
\code{\link[=sq-class]{sq}} object of the same type as input
\code{sq}, where each element is a subsequence created by indexing
corresponding sequence from input \code{sq} object with input indices.
}
\description{
Extracts a defined range of elements from all sequences.
}
\details{
\code{bite} function allows user to access specific elements from multiple
sequences at once.

By passing positive indices the user can choose, which elements they want
from each sequence. If a sequence is shorter than an index, then \code{NA}
value is inserted into the result in this place and a warning is issued.
The user can specify behavior of R in this case by specifying
\code{on_warning} parameter.

Negative indices are supported as well. Their interpretation is "to select
all elements except those on positions specified by these negative indices".
This means that e.g. \code{c(-1, -3, -5)} vector will be used to bite all
sequence elements except the first, the third and the fifth. If a sequence
is shorter than any index, then nothing happens, as it's physically
impossible to extract an element at said index.

As per normal R convention, it isn't accepted to mix positive and negative
indices, because there is no good interpretation possible for that.

\examples{
# Creating objects to work on:
sq_dna <- sq(c("ATGCAGGA", "GACCGNBAACGAN", "TGACGAGCTTA"),
             alphabet = "dna_bsc")
sq_ami <- sq(c("MIAANYTWIL","TIAALGNIIYRAIE", "NYERTGHLI", "MAYXXXIALN"),
             alphabet = "ami_ext")
sq_unt <- sq(c("ATGCAGGA?", "TGACGAGCTTA", "", "TIAALGNIIYRAIE"))

# Extracting first five letters:
bite(sq_dna, 1:5)

# If a sequence is shorter than 5, then NA is introduced:
bite(sq_unt, 1:5)

# Selecting fourth, seventh and fourth again letter:
bite(sq_ami, c(4, 7, 4))

# Selecting all letters except first four:
bite(sq_dna, -1:-4)
