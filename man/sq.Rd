\title{Construct sq object from character vector}
\usage{
sq(
  x,
  alphabet = NULL,
  NA_letter = getOption("tidysq_NA_letter"),
  safe_mode = getOption("tidysq_safe_mode"),
  on_warning = getOption("tidysq_on_warning"),
  ignore_case = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{character}]\cr
Vector to construct \code{sq} object from.}

\item{alphabet}{[\code{character}]\cr
If provided value is a single string, it will be interpreted as type (see
details). If provided value has length greater than one, it will be treated
as atypical alphabet for \code{sq} obejct and \code{sq} type will be
\code{atp}. If provided value is \code{NULL}, type
guessing will be performed (see details).}

\item{NA_letter}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
A string that is used to interpret and display \code{NA} value in the
context of \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq class}}. Default value equals to
"\code{!}".}

\item{safe_mode}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Default value is \code{FALSE}. When turned on, safe mode guarantees that
\code{NA} appears within a sequence if and only if input sequence contains
value passed with \code{NA_letter}. This means that resulting type might be
different to the one passed as argument, if there are letters in a sequence
that does not appear in the original alphabet.}

\item{on_warning}{[\code{"none" || "message" || "warning" || "error"}]\cr
Determines the method of handling warning message. Default value is
\code{"warning"}.}

\item{ignore_case}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
If turned on, lowercase letters are turned into respective uppercase ones
and interpreted as such. If not, either \code{sq} object must be of type
\strong{unt} or all lowercase letters are interpreted as \code{NA} values.
Default value is \code{FALSE}. Ignoring case does not work with \strong{atp}
alphabets.}
}
\value{
An object of \code{\link[=sq-class]{class sq}} with appropriate type.
}
\description{
This function allows the user to construct objects of 
\code{\link[=sq-class]{class sq}} from a character vector.
}
\details{
Function \code{sq} covers all possibilities of standard and non-standard
types and alphabets. You can check what 'type' and 'alphabet' exactly are in
\code{\link[=sq-class]{sq class}} documentation. There is a guide below on
how function operates and how the program behaves depending on arguments
passed and letters in the sequences.

\code{x} parameter should be a character vector. Each element of this vector
is a biological sequence. If this parameter has length 0, object of class
\code{sq} with 0 sequences will be created (if not specified, it will have
\strong{dna_bsc} type, which is a result of rules written below). If it
contains sequences of length 0, \code{NULL} sequences will be introduced (see
\emph{NULL (empty) sequences} section in \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq class}}).

\strong{Important note:} in all below cases word 'letter' stands for an
element of an alphabet. Letter might consist of more than one character, for
example "\code{Ala}" might be a single letter. However, if the user wants to
construct or read sequences with multi-character letters, one has to specify
all letters in \code{alphabet} parameter. Details of letters, alphabet and
types can be found in \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq class}} documentation.
}
\section{Simple guide to construct}{

In many cases, just the \code{x} parameter needs to be specified - type of
sequences will be guessed according to rules described below. The user needs
to pay attention, however, because for short sequences type may be guessed
incorrectly - in this case they should specify type in \code{alphabet}
parameter.

If your sequences contain non-standard letters, where each non-standard
letter is one character long (that is, any character that is not an uppercase
letter), you also don't need to specify any parameter. Optionally, you can
explicitly do it by setting \code{alphabet} to \code{"unt"}.

In \code{\link[=safe-mode]{safe mode}} it is guaranteed that only letters
which are equal to \code{NA_letter} argument are interpreted as \code{NA}
values. Due to that, resulting alphabet might be different from the
\code{alphabet} argument.
}

\section{Detailed guide to construct}{

Below are listed all possibilities that can occur during the construction of
a \code{sq} object:
\itemize{
\item If you don't specify any other parameter than \code{x}, function will
 try to guess sequence type (it will check in exactly this order):
 \enumerate{
 \item If it contains only ACGT- letters, type will be set to
  \strong{dna_bsc}.
 \item If it contains only ACGU- letters, type will be set to
  \strong{rna_bsc}.
 \item If it contains any letters from 1. and 2. and additionally letters
  DEFHIKLMNPQRSVWY*, type will be set to \strong{ami_bsc}.
 \item If it contains any letters from 1. and additionally letters
  WSMKRYBDHVN, type will be set to \strong{dna_ext}.
 \item If it contains any letters from 2. and additionally letters
  WSMKRYBDHVN, type will be set to \strong{rna_ext}.
 \item If it contains any letters from previous points and additionally
  letters JOUXZ, type will be set to \strong{ami_ext}.
 \item If it contains any letters that exceed all groups mentioned above,
  type will be set to \strong{unt}.
 }
\item If you specify \code{alphabet} parameter as any of \code{"dna_bsc"},
 \code{"dna_ext"}, \code{"rna_bsc"}, \code{"rna_ext"}, \code{"ami_bsc"},
 \code{"ami_ext"}; then:
 \itemize{
 \item If \code{safe_mode} is \code{FALSE}, then sequences will be built
  with standard alphabet for given type.
 \item If \code{safe_mode} is \code{TRUE}, then sequences will be scanned
  for letters not in standard alphabet:
  \itemize{
  \item If no such letters are found, then sequences will be built with
   standard alphabet for given type.
  \item If at least one such letter is found, then sequences are built with
   real alphabet and with type set to \strong{unt}.
  }
 }
\item If you specify \code{alphabet} parameter as \code{"unt"}, then
 sequences are scanned for alphabet and subsequently built with obtained
 alphabet and type \strong{unt}.
\item If you specify \code{alphabet} parameter as \code{character} vector
 longer than 1, then type is set to \strong{atp} and alphabet is equal to
 letters in said parameter.
}

If \code{ignore_case} is set to \code{TRUE}, then lowercase letters are
turned into uppercase during their interpretation, unless type is set to
\strong{atp}.
}

\section{Handling \strong{unt} and \strong{atp} types and \code{NA} values}{

You can convert letters into another using \code{\link{substitute_letters}}
and then use \code{\link{typify}} or \code{sq_type<-} function to set type of
\code{sq} to \strong{dna_bsc}, \strong{dna_ext}, \strong{rna_bsc},
\strong{rna_ext}, \strong{ami_bsc} or \strong{ami_ext}. If your sequences
contain \code{NA} values, use \code{\link{remove_na}}.
