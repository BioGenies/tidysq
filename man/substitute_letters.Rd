\title{Substitute letters in a sequence}
\usage{
substitute_letters(x, encoding, ...)

\method{substitute_letters}{sq}(x, encoding, ..., NA_letter = getOption("tidysq_NA_letter"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[\code{sq}]\cr
An object this function is applied to.}

\item{encoding}{[\code{character}]\cr
Letters to be replaced together with their replacements.
One letter can be replaced with multiple symbols.
To perform substitution create a named vector, e.g.
\code{c(A = Ala, H = His, amino_or_nucleic_acid_symbol = replacement)}.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed from or to other methods.}

\item{NA_letter}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
A string that is used to interpret and display \code{NA} value in the
context of \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq class}}. Default value equals to
"\code{!}".}
}
\value{
a \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq}} object with \strong{atp} type with replaced alphabet,
defined by user.
}
\description{
1) Replace ambiguous/extraordinary letters in a nucleic or 
amino acid sequence, stored in a \code{\link[=sq-class]{sq}} object, with the ones
that are compliant with the IUPAC standard, ones that are user-defined 
or with \code{NA} values.

2) Replace default amino acid letters in a sequence with a custom encoding 
to create sequences with simplified alphabets.

The function is only used to replace letters in the alphabet. 
It cannot be used to merge multiple characters into one.
}
\details{
\code{substitute_letters} allows to replace ambiguous/extraordinary 
letters in nucleic or amino acid sequence with user-defined or IUPAC 
symbols. Letters can also be replaced with \code{\link{NA}} values, so that they 
can be later removed, from the sequence, by \code{\link{clean}} function.

\code{substitute_letters} can be used to replace default amino acid letters 
with encodings. They can be user-defined or be derived from various 
simplified alphabets.

One letter of the alphabet may be replaced by a multiple character. 

The alphabet characters to be replaced need to be written in capital letters
and must originate from default alphabets, otherwise error will be 
introduced.

Multiple string of letters to be substituted 
(ex. \code{c(AHG = "replacement")}) will also produce an error.

Replacing multiple letters with the same symbol 
(ex. \code{c(A = "rep1", H  = "rep1", G = "rep1")}) is allowed.

Created sequence will be stripped of \strong{cln} subtype, 
if the original sequence possessed it. This will also occur when
the letter to be replaced will not be found in the sequence. 
It remain unchanged but will lose subclass.

The newly constructed will have a new type \strong{atp}, 
representing sequences with atypical alphabet.

All replaced letters will have the character type. 
Multiple symbol replacement will be recognized as one letter and 
cannot be separated in future operations into single letters.
