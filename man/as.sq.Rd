\title{Convert an object to sq}
\usage{
as.sq(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a object of a class that supports conversion to \code{\link{sq}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to the method.}
}
\value{
A \code{sq} object
}
\description{
This generic function takes an object of arbitrary type and returns an \code{\link{sq}} object 
as an output. Default implementation of the method throws an error - there needs to be 
implemented a method for specified class in order for function to work.
}
\details{
In \pkg{tidysq} only for \code{\link{character}} vector there is an implemented method 
which in fact works exactly like \code{\link{construct_sq}} - you can also pass other arguments
like those supported by \code{\link{construct_sq}}.
