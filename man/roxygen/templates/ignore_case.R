#'  If turned on, lowercase letters are turned into respective uppercase ones
#'  and interpreted as such. If not, either \code{sq} object must be of type
#'  \strong{unt} or all lowercase letters are interpreted as \code{NA} values.
#'  Default value is \code{FALSE}. Ignoring case does not work with \strong{atp}
#'  alphabets.
